# Blockworld
TL;DR:
Blockworld is a modern *minecraft (java version) implementation* which has better performance, and minecraft modders can easily port their mods into this minecraft implementation.

## What does Blockworld do
- Provide better minecraft experience for players.
- Modular design, which means you can use Blockworld as a voxel game engine.
- Provide easy api to mod the game.
- Looks like minecraft.
- No code obfuscation: everyone can modify the source code.
- Port your minecraft world into Blockworld easily.
- Fix some major bugs in minecraft. However some bugs which is useful(like quasi-connection) won't be deleted.
- Multi-threading.
- Cross-platform.
- Be able to write mods in your favorite programming language.

## What doesn't Blockworld do
- Use the same data format(like named binary tag) as minecraft. However we will provide a converter
- Reimplement every detail of minecraft.
- Follow the offical update of minecraft. We think the content of 1.12.2 is enough. But the content of higher version of minecraft will be maintained by community.


## Minecraft is Dying

Minecraft, as a popular game, has been loved for many years.
Its huge community created plenty of various mods and gameplay.
Ironically, mojang seems not to know that not everybody likes their tedious updates -- axolotls, suspicious sands, wolves. Do we really need them?
Isn't mods like _Create_ better than offical updates? 
Minecraft *should* be like lego bricks, like a playground, like a game framework, rather than a boring RPG game.
If it has to be a RPG game, it should be done by *mods* like _twilight forest_.

That's why I decided to make a new minecraft, which is suckless.

Our goal is giving the ability of making new gameplays.
